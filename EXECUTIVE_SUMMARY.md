# VoteNow - Executive Summary

## The Opportunity
**15M+ DAO token holders** worldwide, but **<5% participation** in governance votes.

**Why?** Voting is fragmented (1000+ DAOs), complex (hard to understand proposals), and unrewarding (no incentives).

## The Solution
**VoteNow** = Multi-chain governance aggregator + AI analysis + gamified rewards

**How it works:**
1. **Aggregate** proposals from 20+ major DAOs in one dashboard
2. **Analyze** using AI (DeepSeek) - risk scoring, personalized recommendations
3. **Vote** with one click (MetaMask, no gas fees via Snapshot)
4. **Earn** points (40-100 per vote) → redeem for USDC, NFTs, benefits

## Traction (Live MVP)
- ✅ 20 DAOs across 4 chains (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon)
- ✅ Real Snapshot voting (EIP-712 signatures)
- ✅ AI-powered analysis via DeepSeek
- ✅ 9 reward items (10 USDC = 1,000 points)
- ✅ 75 automated tests passing

## Business Model
1. **Platform fees**: 5% on reward redemptions ($50K/mo @ 10K users)
2. **Premium subs**: $9-49/month ($30K/mo @ 1K users)
3. **DAO grants**: Partnerships with Arbitrum, Gitcoin, Optimism ($20K/mo)

**Year 1 Revenue**: $1.2M
**Break-even**: Year 2 @ 30K monthly active users

## Competitive Advantage
| Competitor | What They Do | What They're Missing |
|------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Snapshot | Voting infrastructure | No aggregation, no AI, no rewards |
| Tally | On-chain governance UI | Only Ethereum, no Snapshot, no AI |
| Boardroom | DAO data aggregation | No voting, no rewards |

**VoteNow uniqueness**: Only platform with multi-DAO voting + AI + rewards in one product.
